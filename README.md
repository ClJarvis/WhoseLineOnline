The preformers take the suggestion an createa live show. Using nonverbal communication player ! trying to get player 2 to solve the clue. This is an attempt to use audience to player A remotly.

Audience fills out form on auidence facing page. The form asks for a famous person, place, an item. Player A has a access to the results page that will randomly display a set of three options for each item he can use. It mixes the items so group A has a person place, item from different viewers. group B three different suggestions. and group C a third set.

Results page text is larger so player 1 can see from a distance.
