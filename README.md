# Whose Line Online

This is a virtual audience suggecstion box for a streaming improv show. At the In person person show audience members shout out suggestions to the preformers to do a skit. The preformers take the suggestion and create a live show using nonverbal communication. Player 1 trying to get player 2 to solve the clues. This is an attempt to send audience suggestions to player A remotely.

Audience fills out form on auidence facing page. The form asks for a famous person, place, an item. Player A has a access to the results page that will randomly display a set of three options for each item he can use. It mixes the items so group A has a person place, item from different viewers. group B three different suggestions. and group C a third set.

Results page text is larger so player 1 can see from a distance.
